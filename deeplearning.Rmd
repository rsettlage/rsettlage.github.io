I like computer simulations.  That is like dumb science though.  What if the computer could actually make decisions.  Woah.  Perhaps that is a little too Terminator for where we are at currently, but, how far away is that?  Probably not terribly far off.  As with the MCMC collection, I am going to start at the start of my understanding and see where I get.  I particularly like the adversarial networks and reinforcement learning so will likely spend more time on those.
