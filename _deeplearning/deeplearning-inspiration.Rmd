I like computer simulations. That is like dumb science though. What if the computer could actually learn and make decisions. Woah. Perhaps that is a little too Terminator for where we are at currently, but, how far away is that? Probably not terribly far off. As with the MCMC collection, I am going to start at the start of my understanding and see where I get. In the realm of Deep Learning, I particularly like adversarial networks and reinforcement learning so will likely spend more time on those.

Here, I am going to start with what I see as the motivation for DeepLearning, biology and the perceptron. A particularly good coffee table resource is:

Much of AI/Machine Learning/Deep Learning history is steeped in replicating nature, specifically the functions of the brain. Drilling down into the brain, we get to neurons. Neurons take input from dendrites, pass these as signals through the axon, which are then transmitted through synapses to the dendrites of another neuron. Modelling the functional behavior of neurons is a feat. Enter the perceptron.

## Perceptron

The [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) for Perceptron's is pretty complete and I will just quote it:

> In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

So, the perceptron is essentially an over simplified model of our understanding of neurons. The perceptron is an algorithm that can be tuned to perform classification tasks. Since we are simplifying, let's draw the neuron using input/output labels as our new perceptron.

```{r fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Simple perceptron."}
include_graphics("./images/perceptron.drawio.png")
```

Above, in our over simplified neuron, we see the components of our perceptron are inputs, x's, importance weights, w's, an activation function, f(z), and output, y. We will talk through these parts and then implement this in a simple learning model.

### Inputs

In our perceptron understanding of neurons, we accept inputs as the start to our algorithm. The inputs can be any type of data, for instance, continuous values such as height, weight, or width, or even discrete values such as counts or class memberships such as word labels in text analytics. When we think of these inputs in our neuronal understanding, they will often be combined with a bias as in the augmented image below. In the neuron, the bias is considered a threshold value below which the neuron will not "fire" or activate. In our perceptron, this is limiting to the case of binary classification, useful, but not complete in that we can use the perceptron for tasks other than binary classification as we will see below.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Perceptron with bias drawn with draw.io."}
include_graphics("./images/perceptron2.drawio.png")
```

### Weights

These are the things we need, the parameters of the model. In a linear models class, these would be our $\beta$'s. The weights are numerical values that indicate the importance of the specific input dimension, ie $x_i$. The perceptron learning algorithm will learn these through iteration, likely using some permutation of gradient descent. As mentioned above, we are adding a bias to the algorithm. This is functionally equivalent to an intercept in a linear model. I have labeled it as "b" and given it a weight, $w_0$, it is convenient to assume b=1 and add this as a dimension to our data as $x_0$.

### Z

We need a function to combine the data with the appropriate weights. This is generally given the sybmol "z" or in some figures the symbol for sum: $\sum$. Setting the bias $x_0 = 1$ and learning the associate weight ($w_0$) leaves us with: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
\textbf{z} = \sum_i w_i \ast x_i = \textbf{w}\cdot\textbf{x}
\end{equation}
$$

### Activation function

The activation function, $f(z)$ can take on many forms. In it's simplest form, it is simply the identity, ie $f(z)=z$. This effectively makes the perceptron a linear model. Turning to classification, the activation function becomes the Heavyside step function, or a mapping $z$ to (0,1).

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{2}
f(z) = 
\begin{cases}
1 \text{ if } z = \textbf{w} \cdot \textbf{x} > 0 \\
0 \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

Activation functions are a varied and active area of research. Common activation functions in neural networks include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh among others. Choice of activation function depends highly on the goals of the algorithm and will be discussed in its own future post.  Here I will simply give the sigmoid activation function and state that it is appropriate and useful in categorical settings where a probability is desired.  The sigmoid function looks like:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{3}
f(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{w}\cdot\textbf{x}}} \equiv \sigma(z)
\end{equation}
$$
It is useful to note that $\textbf{w}\cdot\textbf{x} \in [-\infty,\infty]$ such that $f(z) \in [0,1]$.  For those of you that have studied logistic regression, this should look familiar.  In neural network diagrams, you will often see the sigmoid activation as $\sigma(z)$.

### Outputs

The output of the perceptron is our decision. If using the step function given in (2), the decision may be something as simple as is the image a cat (+1) or not a cat (0). Turning to linear regression, the output is our z's, or y's if that is more familiar.

## Learning
I was hoping to skip this for now, but want to go through an example, so will need to hit on both scoring a result and improving the score.  Essentially, what we are hitting on is the perceptron receives data, applies weights, adds them according to $z$, and finally calculates the function $f(z)$ to create an output $y$.  This output can be a binary (0,1), categorical discrete (0,1,2,...), or a continuous value on some range [0,1].  We often (always?) are fitting some known data.  Using the known data, we can score how well the current settings on weight fit the data.  We do this via a score function often called a cost or loss function in AI/machine learning speak.  If we can score our result, we should be able to improve our score.  We do this through iterative updates, often using a variant of gradient descent and back propagation.  

### Loss function
The loss function is some measure of how good/bad the model performs based on data.  I am going to leave most of this discussion for a different post and just give two here: MSE or L$_2$ error and binary cross entropy.

#### MSE

MSE, L$_2$, or mean squared error is a measure of error well suited for continuous data.  It is calculated exactly as the name suggests, take the mean of the square of the error.  
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\tag{4}
MSE &=& \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \\
  &=& \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\textbf{w}}\cdot\textbf{x}_i)^2
\end{eqnarray}
$$
Remembering that in the above $y = f(z) = \textbf{w}\cdot\textbf{x}$.  The hat $\hat{}$ signifies this is an estimated value, ie the current output of the perceptron using the current values of weights. The last line is simply noting the $x_i$ are likely vectors representing the inclusion of the bias as an x and perhaps multiple dimensions to the data.  Note that MSE is always positive and gets smaller as the prediction and true values converge.

#### Binary Cross Entropy  
Often we are looking to discriminate between categories, cat vs dog, high vs medium vs low, safe vs risky, etc.  In the general case, there can be many categories.  The loss function is effectively a probability distance.  In the case of a binary choice:  


$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{5}
Loss = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^n y_i log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)log(1-\hat{y}_i)
\end{equation}
$$
In this case, the labels, $y_i$'s will be 0 or 1 indicating which class the data point belongs to and the $\hat{y}$'s should be considered a probability of the data point belonging to the 1-class.  Note that only one of the two terms will be active based on the actual label and also that the log will always be negative because $0 \le \hat{y}_i \le 1$, hence the "-" out front to ensure we have a positive value.  Our goal is to minimize the loss.

### Gradient descent
OK, we can calculate an error or loss, how do we do better?  We could take random steps and start to get an idea of what the loss surface looks like, but that seems like a good way to compute for ever (not a bad thing if I am making pretty pictures along the way ;) ).  Instead, we will use a little calculus to figure out in which direction we should step.  Remembering from calculus, if we compute the gradient, we will have an indication of slope at the point evaluated.  

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{6}
w_j^{(t)} = w_j^{(t-1)} - \lambda \ast \nabla_{w_j} Loss(w_j)
\end{equation} 
$$

Thinking of this in terms of a linear model, our cost function is often MSE given above in (4), we need to compute the gradient:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{7}
\nabla_{w_j} Loss(w_j) = \nabla_{w_j} \left[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{\textbf{w}}\cdot\textbf{x}_i)^2\right]
\end{equation}
$$

For a simple linear model, we can simplify our thoughts a little and think of $\textbf{w}\cdot\textbf{x}$ as being $mx + b$.

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\tag{8}
\nabla_{w_{[b,m]}}Loss(w_{[b,m]}) &=& \nabla_{w_{[b,m]}} \left[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (mx_i+b))^2\right] \\
\tag{9}
\nabla_{w_{b}}Loss(w_b) &=& \frac{-2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (mx_i+b)) \\
\tag{10}
\nabla_{w_{m}}Loss(w_m) &=& \frac{-2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - (mx_i+b))
\end{eqnarray}
$$
For binary cross entropy:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\tag{11}
\nabla_{w_{j}}Loss(w_j) &=& \nabla_{w_{j}} \left[-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^n y_i log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)log(1-\hat{y}_i)\right] \\
  && \text{subsituting in (3)} \\
  &=& \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \sigma(z)) \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$


## Example 1: linear model  

We have gone way too long without data. :)  

First, let's get some data:

```{python echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

## create X
observations = 50 
x = np.matrix(range(observations))+1
ones = np.matrix(np.ones(observations))
X = np.hstack([np.matrix(ones).T, x.T])

# create Y
true_weights = np.matrix([[10],[3]])
noise = np.matrix(np.random.uniform(-10,10, size=(observations,))).T
Y = np.matmul(X,true_weights) + noise

# take a peak at our data
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.plot(X[:,1], Y, "x")
plt.style.use('seaborn-notebook')
ax1.grid()
fig1.savefig("fig1.png", dpi=300)
```
![Figure 1: Scatterplot of data drawn using unif(-10,10) as noise.](fig1.png)

Now we need to implement the perceptron.  Given a loss function, it goes as follows:

1. init $\textbf{w}\sim runif(0,1)$  
2. calculate cost (MSE)  
3. update weights according to gradient  
4. repeat 2-3 until some stopping rule (could be number of iterations, could be stability of weights, up to us).  

There are some other things that we should talk about, train/validate/test sets, etc, but we will skip for this post.  For now, let's just do it.  For reference, I am adding the analytical solution from a linear models class:

```{python echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

## ok, do gradient descent
def gradient_descent(x, y, w_init, learning_rate):
    N = x.shape[0]
    w_grad = w_init
    ## need a stopping rule, could just be iterations, could also be a min move
    ## using matrix algebra to simplify this a bit
    maxIteration = 100000
    for i in range(maxIteration):
        error = y - x * w_grad #observed - predicted
        gradient = -2/N * (x.T * error)
        w_grad = w_grad - learning_rate * gradient
    return w_grad

w_start = np.matrix([[0],[0]])
learning_rate = 0.001
w = gradient_descent(X,Y,w_start,learning_rate)

# exact solution using slr inv(x'x)*x'y
w_exact = np.linalg.inv(X.T*X)*X.T*Y

# take a peak at our how we did
fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()
plt.style.use('seaborn-notebook')
ax2.plot(X[:,1], X * w, color="red")
ax2.scatter(np.ravel(X[:,1]),np.ravel(Y), marker="2", color="blue")
ax2.text(25,50,("b = " + str(round(w[0,0],2)) + "; m = " + str(round(w[1,0],2))))
ax2.text(25,40,("b.exact = " + str(round(w_exact[0,0],2)) + "; m.exact = " + str(round(w_exact[1,0],2))))
ax2.set_ylabel("Y")

ax2.grid()
fig2.savefig("fig2.png", dpi=300)
```

## Example 2: binary classification

This starts the same way: get some data.  I was thinking I would produce a simulated dataset, but instead decided to use my new favorite example dataset: the Palmer Penguins.  This is an actual dataset consisting of multiple observations of penguin physical attributes including bill length/depth, flipper length, weight, sex and location measurements.  To keep things simple here, let's imagine we are wanting to come up with a model for predicting sex from bill, flipper and weight measurements.  Further, due to species and location differences, let's limit the dataset to the Gentoo species.  This gives about 124 measurements.

```{r python_setup}

library(reticulate)
conda_list()
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")

```


```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()
g = sns.lmplot(x="flipper_length_mm",
               y="body_mass_g",
               hue="species",
               height=7,
               data=penguins,
               palette=['#FF8C00','#159090','#A034F0'])
g.set_xlabels('Flipper Length')
g.set_ylabels('Body Mass')
plot.show()


df = sns.load_dataset('diamonds')
df.head()

(df
  .filter(['carat', 'color'])
  .query('color in ["E", "G"]')
  .groupby(['color'])
  .agg(['mean'])
  .sort_values(by=('carat', 'mean'), ascending=False)
  )

```


Ideally, we would also talk about multiclass and multilayer perceptrons, but this post is long enough and I will move both of those to another post.  For here, multiclass perceptrons could be thought of similar to binary classification with the exception that the output will be a probability of each class with a softmax performed to call the decision as the class given the maximum probability.  Multilayer perceptrons are, imo, essentially model blending.  Effectively a "hidden" layer is added to the perceptron structure that allows for intermediate and unobserved states, these states are then combined and produce the final output.  Again, we will talk through this in more detail in a future post.
