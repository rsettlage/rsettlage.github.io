## Me

I am a chemist, statistician, and compute junkie all rolled up into one.  I am the bioinformatician doing the COVID surveillance sequencing analysis for SW-VA.  I am the NVidia Deep Learning Institute Ambassador to Virginia Tech.  I love data, bigger is better.  Something big enough to challenge the available compute.  

I love automation.  Do it the first time, it is research, do it a second time, it is productionizing (bug fixing ;) ), a third time is now monotonous and should be automated.  What do I mean by automation, as an example, I have scripts to collect usage stats on a set of HPC clusters every 10 min, 365.  These aren't just for fun, they collect and display cluster status for informing where to submit jobs based on queue congestion.

I also love AI/ML/DL.  To me, teaching the computer to learn from data in a semi automated fashion is the ultimate end goal.  This site is a record of my data science and [AMD]L journey.  I hope to touch on everything from clustering and classification to productionizing and MLOps.

Finally, I a big fan of MCMC methods and will try to create concise summaries of popular algorithms along with some examples of thier use.


## TODO
+ add GitHub calendar
    probably following some permutation of this: "https://dev.to/natterstefan/how-to-add-your-github-activities-to-your-github-profile-5fnl" and this 
    "https://github.com/lepture/github-cards" or this
    "https://ghchart.rshah.org"
