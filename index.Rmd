## Me

While I am a leader in many aspects, I am also a chemist, statistician, and compute junkie all rolled up into one.  I am the bioinformatician doing the COVID surveillance sequencing analysis for SW-VA.  I am the NVidia Deep Learning Institute Ambassador to Virginia Tech.  I love data, bigger is better.  Something big enough to challenge the available compute.  I love automation.  Do it the first time, it is research, do it a second time, it is productionizing (bug fixing ;) ), a third time is now monotonous and should be automated.

This site is dedicated to my data science geek.  I am writing this for me, but hope you will get something from them.  What am I hoping to get from this is both clarity as I write and explain for me and a record of my journey.  I may also include some of my automation projects.  What do I mean by automation, here is a snapshot of my GitHub personal view.  Note that most of the commits are coming from automated usage stat collection on a set of HPC clusters every 10 min, 365.

## TODO
+ add GitHub calendar
    probably following some permutation of this: "https://dev.to/natterstefan/how-to-add-your-github-activities-to-your-github-profile-5fnl" and this 
    "https://github.com/lepture/github-cards" or this
    "https://ghchart.rshah.org"
