Computer simulations have always been my thing.  I love Chao Theory, Fractals, and the like from a computer simulation perspective.  I could code some sort of random walk up and just visualize it's progression ad naseum.  This collection is specific to my learning about and exploring Monte Carlo methods.

The two topics in Monte Carlo methods I like most are Hidden Markov models and time series methods.  I hope to touch on both as this collection matures.
