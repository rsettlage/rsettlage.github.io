I am just a stub for now.  I may make this it's own collection of walk throughs or it may just be a series of reviews.  Not sure, preferences?

Ones I have gone or am going through:
+ Hobbs and Hooten - Bayesian Models: A Statistical Primer for Ecologists  
+ Gelman - Baysian Data Analysis  
+ Goodfellow - Deep Learning  
+ Chollet - Deep Learning with Python  
+ Lanz - Machine Learning with R  
+ Auffarth - Machine Learning for Time-Series with Python
